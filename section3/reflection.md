## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The idea of setting SMART goals to learn programming. I have had my students do this but it didn't cross my mind to use it in this way.
Understanding that mistakes are 'essential to learning'. I can be too hard on myself and I need to internalise this more.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset by:
Enjoying learning new things
Seeing my failures as learning experiences (most of the time)
Have an internal motivation a lot of the time.

I need to practice :
Not taking criticism too personally
Practicing more

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a way of storing an element with a value, the order is not important. The purpose is to have the ability of assigning a value to the different elements within.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {'leash': 27, 'dog food': 122, 'balls': 7, 'treats': 288}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.values[1]

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys
states.values

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
We can use a hash to store a list of athletes with their preferred sport.

An array cannot assign a value to the included element. This is better because you can attach a needed detail.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
How to use them in string interpolation.
