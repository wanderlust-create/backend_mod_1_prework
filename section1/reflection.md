## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I feel that the article was helpful in that it reflected on not just the aspect of studying alone. I appreciate that the author discussed learning as a journey. I am constantly learning new things and feel like it's such a luxury to have the time to study the things I really am interested in.  
One aspect I feel that should be included is taking care of your mental and physical health. If you are not in the right space in these regards, it can be very difficult to practice the things discussed in the article.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
print "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
the #hash

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a whole number. A float includes the decimal point. If you use integers Ruby assumes that accuracy is not important and will round the answer. Using a float will return a more precise answer.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
String interpolation is when you put data into a string.
print "When I lived in Kenya we used to see #{animal}s along the roadside when driving around."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

times.do

end

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

split with argument: Used when you want to split a string but not using the space as the split indicator.
example number.split(",") will use the comma as the split indicator for the variable named number.

gsub: Works as a find and replace all
example greeting.gsub("everyone!", "friends!")
