# Exercise 29 What if AKA
people = 30
cats = 30
dogs = 30

if people < cats
  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
end

if people > cats
puts "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
end

if people < dogs
  puts "The world is drolled on!"
end

if people > dogs
  puts "The world is dry!"
end

# dogs += 5

if people <= dogs
  puts "People are greater than or equal to dogs"
end

if people <= dogs
  puts "People are less than or equal to dogs."
end

if people == dogs
  puts "People are dogs."
end

if people == cats && cats == dogs
  puts 'We are all equal!'
end


  # Study Drills
  # 1. the if command will generate a true/ false condition. If the condition is true then there is an action to be done.
  # 2. Code on like 2 is indented so it is easier to read and understand.
  # 3. The end result is the same.
  # 4. We can use the more complex boolean expressions.
  # 5. The caculations change. We do not receive message for false
